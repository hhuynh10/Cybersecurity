Download Server 2019 ISO: Go to the Microsoft Evaluation Center, select Windows Server 2019, choose the ISO option, and download it. You may need to log in or register to complete the download.
3. Create a Virtual Machine for the Domain Controller
Open VirtualBox: Launch VirtualBox.
Create New VM: Click on New to create a new virtual machine.
Name the VM: Name it "DC" (Domain Controller).
Choose Type and Version: Select Microsoft Windows and Windows 2019 (64-bit).
Memory Allocation: Allocate at least 2048 MB (2 GB) of RAM. If you have more resources, allocate more.
Create Virtual Hard Disk: Follow the default settings to create a virtual hard disk for the VM.
Adjust Settings:
Go to Settings > General > Advanced: Set Shared Clipboard and Drag and Drop to Bidirectional.
Go to System > Processor: Allocate more CPU cores if available.
Go to Network:
Ensure the first adapter is set to NAT (for internet access).
Add a second network adapter and set it to Internal Network (for private communication between VMs).
4. Install Server 2019 on the Domain Controller VM
Start the VM: Double-click the VM or select it and click Start.
Select Server 2019 ISO: When prompted, browse to and select the downloaded Server 2019 ISO.
Begin Installation: Follow the installation prompts:
Select Standard (Desktop Experience).
Accept license terms.
Choose Custom installation and select the virtual hard disk created earlier.
Wait for Installation: The process will take some time, and the VM will restart multiple times. Do not press any keys when prompted during reboots.
5. Initial Configuration of the Server
Set Password for Administrator: When prompted, set a password (Password1 recommended for consistency).
Log in: Use Ctrl+Alt+Delete (from the VirtualBox menu) to log in using the password you just set.
Install Guest Additions:
Go to Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD Image.
Open File Explorer in the VM, go to This PC, and run VBoxWindowsAdditions-amd64.
Follow the installation prompts and choose to reboot later.
Shut Down and Restart the VM: Shut down the VM completely, then restart it to apply changes.
6. Network Configuration
Open Network Settings: In the VM, click the network icon and select Network & Internet Settings.
Identify Network Adapters:
Go to Change Adapter Options.
Check each adapter to identify which is connected to the internet (e.g., an IP like 192.168.x.x) and which is the internal network (likely showing a 169.254.x.x IP).
Rename them for clarity (e.g., Internet for the external adapter and Internal for the internal one).
Set Static IP for Internal Adapter:
Go to the properties of the internal adapter, select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4), and set the following:
IP address: 172.16.0.1
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
DNS server: 127.0.0.1 (loopback address)
7. Rename the Server
Rename the Computer: Right-click the Start menu, select System, and click Rename this PC.
Change the name to "DC": Restart the computer to apply changes.
8. Install Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
Open Server Manager: Click on Add roles and features.
Select Active Directory Domain Services: Follow the prompts to install AD DS.
Promote to Domain Controller:
Click the flag in Server Manager with the warning icon.
Select Promote this server to a domain controller.
Choose Add a new forest and set the domain name to mydomain.com.
Follow the prompts, setting a DSRM password (Password1).
Click Next through the remaining steps and install. The server will restart.
9. Create a Domain Admin Account
Log in to the Domain: Use the domain mydomain\administrator and password (Password1).
Open Active Directory Users and Computers:
Navigate to Start > Administrative Tools > Active Directory Users and Computers.
Create an Organizational Unit (OU):
Right-click mydomain.com, select New > Organizational Unit, and name it MyAdmins.
Create a New User:
Inside MyAdmins, right-click and select New > User.
Name the user (e.g., "Josh Matacor") and set the username (e.g., a-jmatacor).
Set a password (Password1) and uncheck "User must change password at next logon".
Make the User a Domain Admin:
Right-click the new user, select Properties, go to Member Of, and add Domain Admins.
10. Install Routing and Remote Access (NAT)
Open Server Manager: Click Add roles and features.
Install Remote Access: Select Remote Access and proceed with the installation.
Configure Routing:
Go to Tools > Routing and Remote Access.
Right-click the server and select Configure and Enable Routing and Remote Access.
Choose NAT and select the Internet adapter as the public interface connected to the internet.
11. Set Up DHCP
Open Server Manager: Go to Add roles and features.
Install DHCP: Select DHCP Server and follow the prompts.
Configure DHCP:
Go to Tools > DHCP.
Right-click the server, select New Scope, and set the scope:
IP range: 172.16.0.100 to 172.16.0.200
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
Configure additional options:
Router: 172.16.0.1
DNS Server: 172.16.0.1
Activate the scope and authorize the DHCP server.
12. Create a Client VM (Windows 10)
Create a New VM: In VirtualBox, create a new VM for Windows 10.
Install Windows 10: Follow similar steps as with Server 2019 to install Windows 10 on this VM.
Connect to Internal Network: Ensure the VMâ€™s network adapter is set to Internal Network.
Join the Domain:
After installing Windows 10, go to Settings > About and click Join a Domain.
Enter the domain name mydomain.com, and use the domain admin account created earlier to join the domain.
Restart and Log In: Restart the VM and log in with one of the domain user accounts.
13. Final Configuration and Testing
Test Connectivity: Ensure the Windows 10 client can connect to the internet and the domain controller.
Verify AD Functionality: Test domain logins and ensure the DHCP server is assigning IP addresses correctly.
